## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
## 1.Intelligent question generation: 
AI dynamically generates relevant questions based on the applicantâ€™s expertise and job level.Progresses from ice-breaking to in-depth technical & managerial questions.Supports manual question selection & customization by panel members.
## 2. Smart Candidate Response Evaluation: 
AI-driven response analysis evaluates:
 (i)Technical correctness
 (ii)Relevance to the question
 (iii)Depth of knowledge
Provides automated scoring for objective assessment.
## 3. Quantifiable Scoring System
Expert and AI-driven evaluation to minimize bias.
Score metrics include:
(i) Question relevance (Expert vs. Applicant field)
 (ii) Response quality (Accuracy, relevance, depth)
 (iii)Final suitability score for selection.
## 4. Realistic Board Room Interview Simulation
Web-based live panel interviews with AI assistance.
Multi-panel support for experts across locations.
Speech-to-text processing for automated transcription
## 5. Data-Driven Insights & Reports
Candidate Performance Reports with detailed score breakdowns.
Expert Feedback Analytics to refine question patterns.
Bias Detection System ensuring fairness in evaluations.
